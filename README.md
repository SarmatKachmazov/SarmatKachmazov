### 🧠 About Me

I study **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** not for the technology, but for understanding.  
I’m interested in how data turns into knowledge and how patterns become meaningful models.  
I don’t chase perfect accuracy — I care more about *why* a system behaves the way it does.  
Sometimes the answer is in the formula, and sometimes in how you look at it.  

To me, machine learning isn’t competition with the human mind — it’s a continuation of it.  
It’s an attempt to explain the world through logic, patience, and observation.  
I believe the purpose of any model is not prediction, but understanding.  
Everything else is just a path toward clarity.
